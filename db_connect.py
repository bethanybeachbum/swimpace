import psycopg2
# This imports the psycopg2 module in our program. 
# Using the classes and method defined psycopg2 module we can communicate with PostgreSQL.
from psycopg2 import Error
# Using the Error class of psycopg2, we can handle any database error and exception that 
# may occur while working with PostgreSQL from Python. Using this approach we can make our 
# application robust.
# This module helps us to understand the error in detail. It returns an error message and error code.

    # Using the connect() method we can create a connection to a 
    # PostgreSQL database instance. This returns a PostgreSQL Connection Object.

    # or query. Execute method takes a SQL query as a parameter.

    # We can retrieve query result using cursor methods such as fetchone(), fetchmany(), fetcthall().
